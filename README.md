# Maze Runner Themed Project

This project is based off the movie the maze runner

I was watching it this past weekend and thought it would be cool to 
create a project that involves some AI to solve it, 

As this project gets advanced then main goal in the end is this 

- Self Changing Maze (runs 3-5 times per project execution)
- Algorithim or AI that solves it, with a preview of the tries that AI takes
- Attempts are labeled as color based (shows when it hits a intesection or dead-end)
- End Points or Exit Points are labeled with "Nodes"
